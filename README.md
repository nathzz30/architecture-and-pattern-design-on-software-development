# Architecture and Pattern Design Notes

A curated collection of notes and guides about software architecture and design patterns — covering architectural styles, design principles, and best practices for building maintainable & scalable software.

## 📘 What’s inside

- In-depth guides on different architectural styles (e.g. hexagonal architecture, layered architecture, microservices, etc.).  
- Design pattern explanations and how to apply them in real-world projects.  
- Architectural decisions, pros/cons, use-cases, and trade-offs.  
- Best-practice recommendations for organizing code, dependencies, modules — geared toward clarity, testability, and maintainability.

## ✅ Purpose & Motivation

The main goal of this repository is to gather in a single place a reference guide for software developers (from junior to senior) to:

- Understand different software architectures and their trade-offs.  
- Learn when and how to apply classical and modern design patterns.  
- Make informed architecture/design decisions during project planning and implementation.  
- Encourage consistency, scalability and good design across projects.  

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
/ (root)
├── Hexagonal Architecture - A Complete Guide for Developers.md ← Example architecture guide
├── <other-architecture-or-pattern-docs>.md ← Additional guides (to be added)
└── README.md ← This file
```


As the repository grows, you may want to group documents into subfolders (e.g. `/patterns/`, `/architectures/`, `/resources/`) to keep things organized.

## 🚀 How to Use

Simply browse the `.md` files to read about each architecture or pattern.  
Each document is meant as a standalone note or guide, so you can jump to the topic that interests you without a strict order.

## 📚 Recommended Workflow

1. Use this repo as a reference before starting a new project or refactoring an existing one.  
2. Read the architecture/pattern that best fits your project’s needs.  
3. Use the trade-offs and guidelines described to make informed decisions.  
4. (Optional) Copy relevant patterns/designs into your project and adapt them accordingly.

## 💡 Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. You can help by:

- Adding new architecture or design-pattern documents.  
- Improving existing documents with more examples, diagrams, or references.  
- Suggesting corrections, updates, or alternative perspectives.  
- Organizing/refactoring structure (e.g. subfolders, index files) for better maintainability.

If you’d like to contribute, feel free to fork the repository, add your changes, and open a pull request.
